<ul>
  <li>This week we focused on refining the stepper motor as well as integrating the sensor with the motor to change the pressure in a feedback loop.</li>
    <li>This led to an almost complete system as we had the integral components, i.e. the motor and the sensor working in tandem. We spent more time distancing ourselves from the duct tape actuation to laser cut components that worked more relaiably and could be integrated into the final product. This are shown in the images below: ![here](images/laser1.jpg,![here](images/laser2.jpg)</li>
