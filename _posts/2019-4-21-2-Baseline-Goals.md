title: Baseline Goals
---

| What | Why | How | Testing |
|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| Digital Monitoring | To provide<br/>feedback to<br/>medical<br/>professionals | Pressure sensor on<br/>a tube, displaying<br/>on a LCD | Larger tube to be the<br/>trachea, place a breathing<br/>tube inside, try to use<br/>device to read pressure.<br/>Compare with current<br/>accepted measurement<br/>methods |
| Sound Warnings | To alert medical<br/>professionals of<br/>out-of-range<br/>pressure readings | Buzzer | Same as previous goalâ€™s |
| Automatic<br/>Inflation/adjustment | To accurately<br/>inflate the tube to<br/>correct pressure,<br/>and stabilize such<br/>pressure | Servo motor<br/>attached to syringe<br/>of air, pushing in<br/>and out to control<br/>pressure, based on<br/>feedback from<br/>pressure sensor | Once we know that the<br/>pressure sensor is<br/>working, we can try to<br/>inflate and see if we get<br/>the right readings.<br/>Artificially increase and<br/>decrease pressure on the<br/>tube to see if device works |
