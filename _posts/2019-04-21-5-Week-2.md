<ul>
  <li>After consultation with the professor we decided to replace the servo for a stepper motor. This required redisigning the translation of movement from the motor to the syringe.  We started with a duct-taped prototype as shown below ![here](images/duct.jpg).</li>
  <li>We received a pressure sensor after and started to program the mBed to read in the values. ![here](images/pressure.jpg)</li>
  <li>This led us to also create the first version of our tubing system. We decided to allow the doctor access to the standardized syringe port, and also needed to tubing routes for the air--one for our pump and one for our sensor. We put this together as shown in ![here](images/tubing.jpg) </li>
</ul>
