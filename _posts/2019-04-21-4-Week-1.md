<ul>
  <li>We discussed ways to move the syringe using the motor</li>
  <li>Later on in the week, with the above mechanism design already figured out, we 3D-printed some parts and started to assemble the device</li>
  <li>Afterwards, we began to program the motor, and were able to control its motion with a good degree of accuracy</li>
</ul>
