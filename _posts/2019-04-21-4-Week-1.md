<ul>
  <li>We discussed ways to move the syringe using the motor. We settled on using a syringe pump controlled by a servo with a rack and pinion mechanism.</li>
  <li>Later on in the week, with the above mechanism design already figured out, we 3D-printed some parts and started to assemble the device as shown in ![here](images\servo.jpg)</li>
  <li>Afterwards, we began to program the motor, and were able to control its motion but still had some trouble coming up with how exactly we would attach the motor and actuator.</li>
</ul>
