| What | Why | How | Testing |
|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| Automatic<br/>determination of<br/>ideal pressure | To account for<br/>different tracheal<br/>diameters across<br/>patients and<br/>breathing cycles | Constant monitoring<br/>of pressure and<br/>action when a<br/>variation is observed | Same as first goalâ€™s |
