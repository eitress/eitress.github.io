<ul>
  <li>This week we were able to make the tubing more airtight, and completed the integration between sensor readings and actuation</li>
  <li>We were also able to set up the LCD screen and the buttons for controlling the goal amount of pressure</li>
  <li>On Wednesday (05/01), we concluded the last portions of the project: designing and laser-cutting a wooden box for containing the device, and soldering the connections into a smaller breadboard.</li>
  <li>That same day we demoed our project</li>
</ul>
