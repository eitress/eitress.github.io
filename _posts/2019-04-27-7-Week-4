title: Week 04 (Apr 21 - Apr 27)
---

<ul>
  <li>This week we made progress with getting our stepper motor running. We used the H-Bridge driver that we had and got code running to move it back and forth.</li>
  <li>We verified that the motor was able to push the syringe in and out as expected.</li>
  <li>Additionally, we moved towards getting the sensor integrated with the motor by focusing on the sensor.</li>
  <li>Still faced with problems getting consistent readings, we believe that we need to focus on making a better airtight seal within our tubing network and between the tubing and the sensor.</li>
</ul>
