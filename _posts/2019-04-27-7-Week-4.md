<ul>
  <li>Still faced with problems getting consistent readings, we believe that we need to focus on making a better airtight seal within our tubing network and between the tubing and the sensor. We spent a lot of time trobule-shooting if there was an issue with the code, our circuitry, or the air-tightness. Settling on the air-tightness we therefore moved away from tape and used krazy glue adhesive liberally to seal any air gaps. Once allowed to dry overnight, we stopped having problems with the readings.</li>
    <li>
  We additionally spent time connecting an LCD to display the pressure values, and buttons for user input.

  <li>
  By the end of the week we had a working full system, as shown in ![here](images/full1).
