## Week 4/22

Today we made progress with getting our stepper motor running. We used the H-Bridge driver that we had and got code running to move it back and forth. We verified that the motor was able to push the syringe in and out as expected.

Additionally, we moved towards getting the sensor integrated with the motor by focusing on the sensor. Still faced with problems getting consistent readings, we believe that we need to focus on making a better airtight seal within our tubing network and between the tubing and the sensor.
